# Notes

* There are two versions of the helix, `helix-thick` and `helix-thin`. The thin one is typically meant for big icons - for instance, thumbnails, videos, banners, and anything else along those lines. The thick one is typically meant for small icons, like an icon in a taskbar or in our logo.
